Aponte was the creator of an unusual work of art\u2014a &#8220;book of paintings&#8221; full of historical and mythical figures, including black kings, emperors, priests, and soldiers, that he showed to and discussed with fellow conspirators.&nbsp;Aponte\u2019s vision of a black history connected a diasporic and transatlantic past to the possibility of imagining a sovereign future for free and enslaved people of color in colonial Cuba. Although the \u201cbook of paintings\u201d is believed to be lost, colonial Spanish officials interrogated Aponte about its contents after arresting him for organizing the rebellions, and Aponte\u2019s sometimes elaborate, always elusive, descriptions of the book\u2019s pages survive in the textual archival record.<\/p>\n<p class=\"body-text\">In this website, you can read an annotated version of the <a href=\"http:\/\/aponte.hosting.nyu.edu\/transcript\/\">trial record<\/a> of <a href=\"http:\/\/aponte.hosting.nyu.edu\/book-of-paintings\/\">Aponte&#8217;s descriptions of the &#8220;book of paintings.&#8221;<\/a> You can also learn more about the visual and textual references that inspired Aponte.
