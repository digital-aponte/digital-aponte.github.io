Over the course of three days, from March 26 to March 29, 1812, the officials went through the book page by page with Aponte and asked him about its contents. Notaries recorded these interrogations\u00a0into the trial record.\u00a0In interpreting the record, as with any historic document, we contend with various factors that conditioned its production. To begin with, Aponte was on trial for his life and may have made decisions accordingly about what to share. The notaries themselves also made judgments about what to record. Finally, colonial Spanish officials also determined, to a degree, what we know about the book of paintings because they asked more questions of images that interested them than others.<\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 100%; text-align: center;\">\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-1976 aligncenter\" src=\"http:\/\/aponte.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Apontesignature.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"447\" height=\"204\" srcset=\"http:\/\/aponte.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Apontesignature.jpg 3550w, http:\/\/aponte.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Apontesignature.jpg 300w, http:\/\/aponte.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Apontesignature.jpg 768w, http:\/\/aponte.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Apontesignature.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 447px) 100vw, 447px\" \/><\/p>\n<div style=\"width: 447px; margin: auto; text-align: left;\">\n<p class=\"body-text\" style=\"clear: both; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px;\">Aponte&#8217;s signature from &#8220;Expediente sobre el declarante Jos\u00e9 Antonio Aponte el sentido de las pinturas que se hayan en el Libro que se le aprehendi\u00f3 en su casa.

The <em>l\u00e1minas<\/em> depict local black militia units defending the city of Havana against the British in 1762. Many other pages elicited one or two questions, or none at all. For some pages, most noticeably <em>l\u00e1minas<\/em> 52 through 71, Aponte\u2019s answers\u00a0are extremely brief, and no questions were posed by officials. Regarding\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/aponte.hosting.nyu.edu\/transcription\/lamina-60a\"><em>l\u00e1mina<\/em> 60a<\/a>, Aponte offers only one sentence (that the notary recorded, at any rate): \u201cNumber sixty represents Nerpomene, the goddess of battles.\u201d The unevenness of the interrogation corresponds to the officials\u2019 view of\u00a0problematic imagery and its possible connection to\u00a0Aponte\u2019s role in organizing the slave rebellions. The same unevenness, unfortunately, also impacts our knowledge of the \u201cbook of paintings.\u201d<\/p>\n<p class=\"body-text\"><a href=\"http:\/\/aponte.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Aponte-Trial-Transcript-Jorge-Pavez-Ojeda.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1962\" style=\"display: inline; margin: 0px 0px 7px 0px;\" src=\"http:\/\/aponte.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/pdf.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"16\" height=\"16\" \/><\/a>\u00a0<a href=\"http:\/\/aponte.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/10\/Aponte-Trial-Transcript-Jorge-Pavez-Ojeda.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Click here to download a transcription of the trial testimony completed by scholar Jorge Pavez Ojeda.<\/a><\/p>\n<div class=\"container\" style=\"width: 100%;\">\n<div class=\"body-text row\">\n<div class=\"col-8\">\n<p>Click on the arrow below to read more about the &#8220;book of paintings&#8221; and view a subject matter list of its contents with links to each <em>l\u00e1mina<\/em>.\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"col-4\"><a class=\"btn btn-default btn-sm\" style=\"float: right;\" href=\"http:\/\/aponte.hosting.nyu.edu\/book-of-paintings\/\" type=\"button\">Continue to l\u00e1minas <\/a><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Following Aponte&#8217;s arrest for conspiring to plan slave rebellions, colonial Spanish officials questioned him extensively about his \u201cbook of paintings.\u201d They had found the book in a pine box hidden inside a chest full of clothes when they searched his [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"page-templates\/full-width.php","meta":{"footnotes":""},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/aponte.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/23"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/aponte.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/aponte.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/aponte.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/aponte.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=23"}],"version-history":[{"count":157,"href":"http:\/\/aponte.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/23\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":185,"href":"http:\/\/aponte.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/23\/revisions\/185"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/aponte.hosting.nyu.edu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=23"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
